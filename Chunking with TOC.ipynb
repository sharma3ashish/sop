      "30\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep the jar in tension at all times. If the jar is accidentally closed\n",
      "during surface handling, it must be extended to the fully opened\n",
      "position before running into the hole. Support the weight below the\n",
      "jar in the slips and pick up 5 to 10Kps with the elevators. Continue to\n",
      "apply this force until the jar is fully extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Handling of SDMM & RSS may be carried out as per instructions of the\n",

      "trips can be carried out earlier than the recommended values.\n",
      "Frequency of wiper trips should be increased in wells with high chances\n",
      "of Key Seat formation. Short trips should be done only for specific cases.\n",
      "37. Tandem / Hi-Vis pills are to be used to ensure proper hole flushing. The\n",
